**7DTD-ServerMod**

This project seeks to provide a PHP based control panel that can be used to manage a 7DTD Server.

The control panel should provide the ability to:

- Start, Stop, and Force Stop your 7DTD Server (implemented through scripts provided by my docker-ubuntu-7dtd & docker-centos-7dtd projects)
- View the 7DTD Server Log(s) (implemented, but still basic)
- Easy Select/Deselect application of Modlets (implemented, with no configuration file required)

The Web interface manages files within your 7dtd game server installation so your webserver should be configured to run as the same user that will run your gameserver. If you start your journey with either docker-c7-7dtd or docker-ubuntu-7dtd you will end up with a fully usable 7DTD game server with an easy control panel to manage your enabled modlets.

This project is currently configured for 58 packages providing 468 modlets.
More modlets and full mods will  be applied in the near futer
*****Please be patient with us as this project is still under development.*****
